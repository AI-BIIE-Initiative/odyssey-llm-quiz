# ‚õµ Odyssey LLM Knowledge Integration Benchmark üè∫


Welcome!

This repository is part of the BIIE AI Initiative Technical Assessment. The challenge is designed to evaluate and improve the literary comprehension skills of an LLM specifically [`google/flan-t5-small`](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small) on a QA benchmark built from a chapter of Homer's Odyssey.

The goal of this assessment is to provide both the code and a report that demonstrate efforts to improve the performance of the [`google/flan-t5-small`](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small) model on the provided benchmark. Equally important is to clearly explain the decision-making process, including the rationale behind each technical choice and to present the results in a structured manner.

### What You Will Find in This Repository

You will be working with the following assets:

- A chapter from *The Odyssey* (provided in plain text format). [`The_Odyssey_chapter_10.txt`](The_Odyssey_chapter_10.txt)
- A set of multiple-choice questions assessing comprehension and reasoning from the chapter.[`OdysseyMCQ_balanced.json`](OdysseyMCQ_balanced.json)
- Evaluation code in [`evaluation.py`](evaluation.py), which was used to assess the baseline performance of the Google FLAN model [`google/flan-t5-small`](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small), and currently achieves **20% accuracy** on the same set of questions.


---

### üéØ Your Objective

Your goal is to **improve the model‚Äôs accuracy** by leveraging the content of the provided chapter using the **Google FLAN** model as the baseline.

Specifically:

- You must use the **`google/flan-t5-small`** model from Hugging Face.  
  This lightweight model is easy to use, quick to load, and ensures consistent comparisons across submissions.

  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

  model_name = "google/flan-t5-small"
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
  model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)


- Explore and justify techniques that can help the model understand and reason better over literary texts.
- Implement and evaluate improvements using the existing benchmark framework.
- You may choose to use retrieval augmentation, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or other NLP techniques‚Äîyour design choices should be clear and defensible.

## üìù Final Notes

This assessment is **not just a coding exercise**. It is designed to evaluate your technical reasoning, creativity, and communication‚Äîcore qualities of effective engineers.

### What You Should Do

1. **You are encouraged to upload and include anything you find necessary** to support your solution‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs custom code, evaluation scripts, visualizations, reference materials, or documentation.  
   > üßæ A Jupyter or Colab **notebook is preferred** for its ability to combine code, results, and reasoning in a single, readable format.

2. **You are free to approach the benchmark however you see fit.**  
   Feel empowered to:
   - Fix or redesign the evaluation pipeline
   - Refactor question formatting or handling
   - Engineer prompts or augment the dataset
   - Try any method you believe could improve the LLM‚Äôs performance  
   > This is your chance to show **how you think**, not just how you code.

3. **This is an open-ended assessment.**  
   We're looking at your ability to:
   - Explore and justify engineering decisions
   - Communicate design trade-offs
   - Reflect on outcomes with appropriate metrics and plots  
   > Think of it as solving a small, real-world problem where clarity and intent matter more than perfection.

4. **Using LLMs during development is encouraged.**  
   Whether it‚Äôs ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any other tool:
   - Feel free to use them for coding, exploration, or research.
   - Just **explain how and why you used them**.  
   > For instance: ‚ÄúUsed Claude to explore prompt design alternatives and chose X because‚Ä¶‚Äù

5. **Push everything to this repository.**  
   Your final submission should include:
   - Your completed notebook (`.ipynb`)
   - Any additional code, scripts, or helper files you created
   - Plots, figures, or results that support your explanation  
   > Please commit and push all relevant files to the root or appropriate folders in this repo before submission.
